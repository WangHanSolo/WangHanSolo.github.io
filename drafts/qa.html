        <p>
           Here are some common questions I get from youth groups.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Youth: Why do you read the bible?<br> Me: Life is like building a skyscaper, its important to have a blueprint.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Students: What is the best way to study?<br> Me: Study with joy.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Youth: What side should I take on this controversial topic?<br> Me: Take the side of listening and understanding.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Youth: Is it easy to bully good people? <br> Me: A good sheep always have a shepherd watching over.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Youth: How do we live a good life among so much evil? <br> Me: We can stay healthy even surrounded by germs</li>
            <br>
            <li>Students: Why spend so much time to research a topic? Spending so much time on writing a thesis. Spending so much energy. What is the purpose?<br>
                Me: If it is done with purpose, then the biggest goal is to understand what purpose is.</li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Youth: Why does Jesus ride a lame donkey into Jeruselum and not a ferocious T-Rex? <br>
                Me: Victory in humility, not pride.</li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Youth: I keep thinking about my ex-girlfriend.<br> 
                Me: Your value doesn't decrease based on someone's inability to see your worth. What can you do now to start this new chapter with a bang?</li>
            <br>
            <li>Youth: How do I walk out of disappointment?<br>
                Me: Hope is like a piece of paper. It will be continuously torn apart. Yet, God is able to use the torn pieces to compose a more beautiful mosiac.</li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Students: What is your most regretful moment? <br>
                Me: Lift up the past to the Lord. He can turn past mistakes to beauty and glory.</li>
            <br>
        </ol>
