Some study techniques accelerate learning, whereas others are just a waste of time. Below are studying techniques that I used to great effect during undergrad. 

# Distributed Practice
Spread your study over time. I like to prepare for exams at least 2 weeks in advance and set milestones for each day. Maybe its a chapter, maybe its self testing, you have higher recall after spaced study


# Organizing Notes
I strive to organize my notes in a manner such that I can share it with everyone in my study group. Not only does this help me identify what areas where my understanding is not concrete, but also gives a chance for my peers to point out gaps in my knowledge.

# Teaching
I love to be part of study groups. Not only can my peers keep me accountable, but I observed that I put more effort to learn material when I know I might need to explain it to someone else [(protege effect)](https://www.ausmed.com/publish/handover/learning-theories/what-is-the-protege-effect).


<br/><br/>
Lets talk about techniques that are not as effective and can give a false impression of studying...

# Highlighting
Simple, quick, ineffective. Reduces ability to draw inferences.


# Rereading notes or text books
The second reading seems valuable, not so much after that.
